class Interval(object):
    """
    Time interval.

    This class represents a temporal interval. It contains methods for
    determining whether two intervals overlap and for calculating that overlap.

    The default values for the keyword arguments assume that time is measured
    in seconds and set the minimum overlap to 30 milliseconds and the minimum
    overlap fraction to 0.5.

    Parameters
    ----------
    start : float
        Start of the interval.
    end : float
        End  of the interval.
    minimum_overlap : float, optional
        Minimum time for two intervals to be considered to overlap.
    minimum_overlap_fraction : float, optional
        Minimum fraction of either interval to be considered an overlap.


    Methods
    -------
    length()
        The length of the interval.
    overlap(interval)
        Calculate overlap with another interval.
    overlaps_with(interval)
        Determine whether there is an overlap.
    contains(interval)
        Determine whether another interval is contained in this one.
    is_adjacent(interval)
        Determine whether another interval is adjacent to this one.
    is_left_adjacent_to(interval)
        Determine whether this interval is immediately to the left of another.
    is_right_adjacent_to(interval)
        Determine whether this interval is immediately to the right of another.

    Raises
    ------
